## Get yours

Run these commands in [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code):

```
npx skills add colinho/vibechecked
/vibechecked
```

It will:
1. **Extract your stats locally** — sessions, tokens, tools, timing patterns (nothing leaves your machine)
2. **Analyze your coding style** — determines your persona, memorable moments, and quirks
3. **Generate your story** — a personalized animated experience you can share

All analysis happens on your machine. Only anonymous, aggregated numbers are sent to compute percentiles.
